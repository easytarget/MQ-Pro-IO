# Overlay build system is a Work In Progress
Status:
* can build the example overlay
* cannot deploy/activate the overlay, see issue #7
* and not sure if using overlays is needed, they still have to be built for each new kernel and activated by a reboot. So not much less overhead vs compiling a full device tree.
